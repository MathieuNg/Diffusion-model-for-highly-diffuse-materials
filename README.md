# Diffusion model for Highly Diffuse Material

This repository contains the Python code developed for reading reflectance data profiles acquired 
by using the Dia-Stron TLS850 translucency meter. The method is similar to the repositoru "Diffusion model for TLS50 measurements" (https://github.com/MathieuNg/Diffusion-model-for-TLS850-measurements) but it was written for Python usage.

The details of this algorithm and its conceptualization can be found in our article with the following reference:

For the user, it is required to download the whole repository and use the file main.py.
